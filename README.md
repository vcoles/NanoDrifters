NanoDrifters
The NanoDrifter project is a collaboration by William A. Coles, Victoria J. Coles, and Rainier R. C. Hood
The goal is to produce
    1 Easy to use
    2 inexpensive
    3 drifters for understanding shallow nearshore waterbodies

This repository will contain code for uploading to the drifters themselves as well as codes for analyzing the resulting trajectories (data).
